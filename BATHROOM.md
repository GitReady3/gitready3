|Input              |Process                                 |Output              
|-------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------
|Person says: How do I get to the Bathroom? |Listen to the question and think about an answer |            
|                   |Determine the manner and tone to use to communicate with the person asking the question.                   |
|                   |Check your mood                         |
|                   |    If you are in a good mood           |
|                   |                                        |Smile
|                   |    If you are not in a good mood       |
|                   |                                        |Don't smile, but try not to be rude       
|                   |Determine the level of specificity the person asking the question will need - should I ask them to count steps, or will vague directions be enough? Tailor your output to the desired audience |                     
|                   |Determine where the bathroom is in relation to your current location |          
|                   |                                        |Speak: When you leave this room (room 440/441), turn left and continue past the elevators.          
|                   |Determine the landmarks that should be used to identify if the user is on the right track e.g. Customer service or the student lounge |    
|                   |                                        |Stay Silent               
|                   |Determine the landmarks that should be used to determine if the user has gone too far e.g. Room 408 (the room with the full length glass windows to the side)|    
|                   |                                        |Speak: Turn left just before the glass doors to the reception. Look for the bathrooms on your left.
|Person thanks you  |                                        |
|                   |Understand that gratitude has been expressed and respond accordingly        |
|                   |                                        |Speak: You're welcome
